Instructions for taking drone and robot images from fields and software for field mapping nad analysis.

## Field mapping process
1.	Using drone or robot for field monitoring
2.	Mapping the field
3.	Analyzing the field

## Using drone for field monitoring
### Purchasing drone
A light drone with high resolution RGB camera. One additional battery for 0.5 ha of field.
Examples

## Mapping the field
Usually, programs creating maps by stitching together separated drone images are expensive, work long time, and distort images. All this is not required for a simple field analysis, which can be done based on separate images. A program FieldOwl is created for a simple analysis, and it is light, free and no installations are required.
